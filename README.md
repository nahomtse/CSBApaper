This project is an assignment for the MSc Econometrics course "Computer Science For Business Analytics (FEM21037)" from the Erasmus University of Rotterdam. The project takes a close look at duplicate detection using data from the file "TVs-all-merged.json" containing information of 1624 online advertisements for televisions. The data is pre-processed using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to reduce the number of comparisons to be made. First, model-words are extracted from product title and key value pairs and trans-formed into binary vector representation for the product. Afterwards LSH has been applied to this representation. This pre-selects potential duplicates and can be used as input as Multi-component Similarity Method (MSM), which is the final step of the duplicate detection method and finds the duplicates. Compared to original MSM, the number of needed computa-tions can be reduced but this method does not outperform the MSMP+ method. Buddy: Jelle Willekes.
